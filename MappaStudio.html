                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAPPA (MAPPA Co., Ltd.) is a Japanese animation studio founded by <strong>Masao Maruyama</strong> in
                                June 2011, following his departure from Madhouse. It employs 360 people as of April 2023 between its
                                Tokyo and Sendai studios. Maruyama's intent was for the film Kono Sekai no Katasumi ni (In This Corner
                                of the World) to be the studio's first release, though the project would not be complete until 2016.
                                By that time, the studio had already co-produced Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope) and Hajime
                                no Ippo: Rising, and released its first original anime—Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance).</p>

                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name MAPPA is an acronym for Maruyama Animation Produce Project Association. Maruyama stepped
                                down as president in 2016 to form Studio M2. He was replaced by former Studio 4°C employee Manabu
                                Ootsuka.</p>

                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The studio was established by <strong>Masao Maruyama</strong>, a co-founder and former producer of
                                Madhouse, at the age of 70. Maruyama served as the company's first representative director, and
                                the studio's initial goal was to produce Sunao Katabuchi's In This Corner of the World. Due to
                                financial difficulties at Madhouse, Maruyama and Katabuchi established MAPPA in the hopes of producing
                                the film; however, despite moving studios, the film had a lot of production troubles, and wasn't
                                released until 5 years later. Maruyama first started working with Katabuchi for the film in 2010
                                during Madhouse era, but it took three years to start the production due to difficulties to raising
                                funds.</p>

                            <h2>Early Life</h2>
                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maruyama was born in <i>Shiogama in Miyagi Prefecture</i> in 1941.</p>

                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963. After hanging around for a while without
                                a regular job, he joined Mushi Production in 1965, which a friend introduced him to.
                                Those were the early days of Japanese TV animation, and Mushi Pro, a pioneer in this field,
                                was always short on staff. It was not a job he particularly wanted, but he was fascinated
                                by animation after experiencing culture shock by Osamu Tezuka, the head of Mushi Pro.</p>

                            <h2>Career</h2>
                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1972, Maruyama left Mushi Productions, which was facing a financial crisis, to found Madhouse,
                                along with his colleagues including Osamu Dezaki, Rintaro, and Yoshiaki Kawajiri, and in 1980, he
                                became the president. Since then, he has focused on planning, producing and production
                                design for numerous Madhouse TV series, OVAs and theatrical film. The 1993 film Jūbē Ninpūchō,
                                for which he served as the producer, was released on video in North America under the title Ninja
                                Scroll, and sold nearly half a million copies.</p>

                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the main producer and studio head of Madhouse, Maruyama was personally responsible for
                                green-lighting new projects. As a result, projects were often directly pitched to him by outside
                                interests or brought to him by creators within the company. He also had a significant amount of
                                influence in determining the staff of these new projects, particularly in the assignment of
                                directorial duties. In addition, he was frequently involved in the planning phase of major
                                studio productions at Madhouse.</p>

                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maruyama has also planned and produced some of the best-known and rising films of famous
                                directors, such as all of Satoshi Kon's films (Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers,
                                Paprika), Mamoru Hosoda's The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and Summer Wars, and Sunao Katabuchi's
                                Mai Mai Miracle. After the release of Paprika, Maruyama had been preparing for Satoshi
                                Kon's next film, Dreaming Machine, but the film's production has been suspended when Kon passed
                                away suddenly in August 2010.</p>

                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2010, Maruyama served as the executive producer for an anime project based on the TV show
                                Supernatural, entitled Supernatural The Animation, and is the world's first animated project
                                from a Japanese anime studio based on an overseas drama series.</p>

                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2010 to 2011, Iron Man, Wolverine, and Blade, three works from the Marvel Anime Project,
                                of which Maruyama is one of the planners, were broadcast on Animax in Japan.</p>

                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2011, Maruyama left Madhouse and established a new animation production company,
                                MAPPA (an acronym for Maruyama Animation Produce Project Association), at the age of 70.
                                MAPPA had a production room for Sunao Katabuchi's In This Corner of the World since the very
                                beginning in 2016. Maruyama first started working with Katabuchi for the film in 2010 during
                                the Madhouse era, but it took three to four years to start production due to difficulties in
                                raising funds.</p>

                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in April 2016, Maruyama handed over the presidency of MAPPA to founding member Manabu Otsuka
                                and newly established Studio M2, specializing in planning and pre-production. At the age of 75,
                                Maruyama wanted to execute at least two more big projects, so he established the studio to prepare
                                for the execution of his projects even if he was gone.</p>

                            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2023, Maruyama joined N LITE Japan, led by its CEO and producer Shin Koyamada, as the Board
                                member, and is set to produce an anime film Mfinda.</p>
